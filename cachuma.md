A lovely weekend spent in midst of beautiful landscape and in a pretty city. Santa Barbara is surrounded by Los Padres National Forest on three sides and Pacific ocean on the other. This is the place to be in Summer to enjoy the best temperature in world. We booked the zipcar for a day and started our trip from 11 am. It was bright and sunny outside. 
The original plane was to visit red rock pool, lake cachuma, Solvang and lake Casitas. We were off to Red Rock hill first. We chose this because of the waterfall which creates a swimming pool in the bottom. It's a good idea to look into siteseeing websites (link) about the trail and parking place rather than believing on google maps. We followed the route suggested by google maps and met "Road is closed" sign. The route cut through the mointains so it was spiral around it which could make you car sick. But, it was not all in vain. the unique ocean view from above the mountains was captivating. The blue sea with blue skies and greenary all around will fill you with ultimate sense of tranquility.

After rolling downhill, we went straight to lake Cachuma. This time the google map destination was set to Lake Cachuma gift shop. The parking cost was only ten dollars. We spend a quality of time here. A large span of blueberry-blue lake was making it appear like sky on earth. The burbling sound from streams and soft low humming wind breeze made the atmosphere perfect for a nap :D The lake was crystal-clear and tranquil, flanked by the steep mountains. This wil be my spot in Santa Barbara.(picture)

Solvang (link)! A little Denmark in America! It is indeed a lovely place with beatuiful colorful little houses. Four blocks of alluring gift shops and Danish pastries restaurants are worth walking through. Walking for an hour within the city was not enough to satisfy the soul. Everytime the streets look new and different. It has one of the most beautiful subway restaurants. With a park in the middle of the city, this place
