Earlier, I didn't use to like salads. In India, we mostly have cooked foods, so eating salad for a meal seemed weird. Also, I used to laugh at the idea of paying for an uncooked meal. I generally buy lunch and try new restaurants every day. I tried salad from American restaurants and now I realize I have started becoming fond of salads. It feels fresh and light after eating it. I now prefer salad over a burger or sandwich.  There are other changes also in my diets. I have started developing an aversion to cheese and milk because of the smell. So, nowadays it is becoming more difficult to find a restaurant which serves good lunch and fits my constraint at a reasonable price. I have tried the only three Indian restaurants here in Santa Barbara and they are not good. I miss the Indian restaurants in London (I found one better than any restaurant I have ever tried in India).
