## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="shailja.jpg">
I am a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Barbara in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. I received my bachelor's degree from the Electrical Engineering Department, IIT Kharagpur.


## Research Interest
I am passionate about research on image processing, and design and analysis of algorithms. I am also interested in the applications of my work on computer vision and software engineering to robotics.

At University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), I worked on automated image segmentation and its analysis using high resolution ultrasound imaging. I worked in the Visualization and Image Analysis [(VIA) Laboratory](http://www.vialab.org/main/Home/People.html) with Prof. George Stetten. We demonstrated a novel and intuitive method using an improvement of Descending Variance Graphs (DVG) for automated segmentation of neurological structures.

I was a Visiting Researcher at University of Washington (UW) in Computing and Software Systems Division under the guidance of Prof. Tyler Folsom for 3 months. I worked on [Localization and Navigation of a Self Driving Tricycle, Elcano](https://github.com/Sailja/elcano), an open source software which is written in C++. I developed the software for the following modules:
* Navigator: Reads data from GPS, speedometer, compass and optical mouse to get best position estimate.
* Vision: Developed and extended the vision system to be able to identify lane edges as an aid to staying in the lane.

For my bachelors thesis project I worked on [Visual navigation of mobile robot using monocular vision](https://github.com/Sailja/Visual-based-navigation) at IIT Kharagpur under the guidance of Prof. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I presented methods to develop some of the building blocks for a personal assistant robot where I successfully developed novel approach of detecting obstacles using monocular vision.

Please refer to my resume for further details about all of my projects and research experience. I would be glad to answer any questions that you may have about my work or any other projects.
